This repository will create a Kubernetes Cluster, using Kubespray,
so it can be used for a Lab Environment.

It will create 4 VMs:

- node0[1-3]: 1 k8s master and 2 worker nodes (2 vcpu and 4GB RAM each)
- controller: controller node (2 vcpu, 2GB RAM)

`kubectl` binary will be installed on the controller node.

This repository was tested using

![Test Env](docs/images/tested.png)

## Quick Start

![Lab Environment](docs/images/lab.png)

Check the variables defined on the `.env` file.

**NOTE:** The bootstrap uses the ```~/.ssh/id_rsa``` and ```~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```,
so if you don't have these files, you need to create using:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

To create the k8s cluster just run:

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant provision --provision-with k8s
```

You can now connect to the controller node and use kubectl using:

```bash
vagrant ssh controller

kubectl cluster-info
```

## Documentation

- [Requirements](docs/requirements.md)
- [References](docs/references.md)

## Some notes

- This uses the following Vagrant plugins (automatically installed):
  - vagrant-hostmanager
  - vagrant-env
- You can change some variables for kubespray in the `.env` file (or using environment variables)

### Environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to overwrite values from `.env` file:

- KUBESPRAY_VER
